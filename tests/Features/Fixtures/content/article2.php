These space objects are so dense that even light cannot escape their grip. Ever since Einstein first proposed their existence, we\'ve made simulations, art, and CGI versions of what we imagine black holes could look like. But it wasn\'t until this morning that we saw a black hole for the first time. We have finally gazed into the cosmic abyss.',

This galaxy is 55 million light-years away in the Virgo supercluster, and it is 6.5 billion times more massive than our sun. “You\'re looking at a black hole that is essentially the size of our entire solar system,” says Sera Markoff, EHT team member and professor of theoretical astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam.',
